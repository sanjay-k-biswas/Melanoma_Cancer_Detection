# Melanoma Cancer Detection
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


## Conclusions
There is significant improvement from Model 1 to Model 3:

Model 1: Simple CNN Model: OVERFITTING Accuracy: 0.87 | Validation accuracy : ~0.5

Model 2: Data Augment with Dropout: UNDERFITTING Accuracy: 0.63 | Validation accuracy : ~0.5

Model 3: Class rebalance,BatchNormalization with Dropout: OVERFITTING Accuracy: 0.95 | Validation accuracy : 0.79
